# Exploratory Data Analysis in Python

## Course Description

Analysis increasingly depends on use of complex, interconnected data. Due to growing numbers of massive data collections, new tools and methods must be developed and implemented to aid analysts in their daily tasks. This course intends to develop exploratory data analysis skills using the Python programming language. This course will cover introductory programming basics to aid in data collection, processing, storage, and profiling. By the end of the course, analysts will be able to better visualize and communicate about data and how it is situated within a project for modeling and further engineering.

## Course Objectives

This course is intended to foster several technical and systemic skills.

  * Understand the basics of the Python programming language
  * Understand modern data acquisition practices
  * Understand data management and storage practices
  * Understand how to use Python libraries for analysis
  * Understand fundamental data visualization practices

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, analysts should be able to:

  * Create basic programs using Python
  * Use Python to acquire data from a number of sources
  * Use Python to store data for query and analysis
  * Use Python to profile and describe data features
  * Use Python to visualize aspects of data

## Format

This course will be composed primarily of discussions and in-class activities.

## Required Learning Materials

To begin going through this course, the student must have access to a computer that can support the use of Python. Additionally, they must be able to fully engage through web-based conferencing in the event that the course is conducted remotely.

## Schedule

Topics and learning activities are subject to change depending on length allowed for course and location.
